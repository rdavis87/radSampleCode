Returning to the programming world after a long layoff.  This project documents the journey back to writing code. 

1. Sample code to make use of some of the standard C runtime functions. radCRTsamp.
2. Sample code to use the vector and doubly linked list c++ containers.
3. Sample code showing simple OOD principles available in c++.  Also contains an
   implentation of a binary tree.  This ends the work on c++ samples as it is time
   to get on with learning C#.
4. Learning C#.  CSharpBasics is first attempt at C# programming.
